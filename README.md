# bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize data to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines would be profitable. In our challenge, we updated our "tripduration" data to a datetime datatype, and then created visualizations on the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders, and broken down by gender. We also show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders, and even breaking it down further by each day of the week. 

## Results
Please follow the notes below while viewing the Tableau story linked below:

Our first slide in our story, titled "Usage", shows the Citibike usage during hours of the day. We can clearly see that bike usage peaks in the late afternoon. 

Next, our "Total Rides" slide, shows the volume of rides for the entire month of August, with over 2 million rides. Althought this is the data for NYC, it is fair to say that there is enough popularity with the bikes to be profitable. 

Our "Average Checkout Times" slide shows that our average rent time is around 15-20 minutes. We can defer that people use the bikes for a short period of time to move quickly across the city, and with usage peaking in the late afternoon, we can also defer that most of these users are using the bikes to commute. 

Breaking that down by gender on our "Average Checkout Time by Gender" slide, we can see that a vast majority of riders are male. Gender did not affect the Average Checkout Time, as male and females both tended to ride for the 15-20 minute block.

Our "Trips by Weekday per Hour" slide shows us the most popular days for riding, with Thursday being the most popular day, followed by Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. From this visualization we can see again that commuting hours are the most popular.

Breaking this down by gender in our Trips by Gender(Weekday per hour) slide, we can see the males still carry the load of ridership. 

Finally, on our User Trips by Gender by Weekday, we can see that subscribers, rather than regular customers, show higher number overall. Regular customer usage tends to peak on the weekends. 

## Summary
After looking at these slides, we can defer that there are a few groups of customers: subscribers, who probably use the bikes to commute during those respective hours, and casual riders, which are most likely people looking to enjoy a bike ride on the weekend, or tourists. Although it does not have any effect on the ridership during certain hours or checkout times, gender is heavily skewed towards males.

Two additional visualizations that I would perform would be data with Des Moines. Clearly this is a profitable business in NYC, but who knows if this would translate to Des Moines. I would first look at the Average Trip Distance, and see if that could be compared with the size of Des Moines. I would also look at demographics for Des Moines and see if there was enough interest amongst males. I would also compare the temperatures between Des Moines and NYC, and see if that and the time of year have any effect on bike usage.
